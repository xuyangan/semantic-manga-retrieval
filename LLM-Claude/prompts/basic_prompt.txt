Output format: Start immediately with descriptions. One line per character. Separate multiple characters with a blank line. No preamble, headers, or explanations.

Length: 60–70 tokens per character (roughly 12-15 descriptive phrases)

Required elements in order: gender → age range → build → hair (length, tone, style) → facial structure → clothing → overall visual impression (purely visual)

Rules:
* Physical appearance only
* No emotions, actions, poses, gaze, or personality traits
* No inferred, symbolic, or narrative information
* For grayscale manga: describe tones as "light" or "dark" only

Style:
* Natural descriptive language
* Comma-separated phrases
* No metaphors or abstract concepts

Example output:
Male, young adult, athletic build, short spiky dark hair, angular face with sharp jawline, wearing dark high-collared jacket with structured silhouette, clean bold high-contrast visual appearance

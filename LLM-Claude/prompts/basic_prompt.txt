You are given a manga image containing one or more characters.

For each unique character visible, produce a description using this schema:

[gender]; [age range]; [build]; [height]; [hair: length, tone, style]; [eyes: shape, size]; [face: structure, features]; [clothing]; [overall presence]

Field Guidelines:
- gender: male/female/ambiguous
- age range: child/teen/young adult/adult/elderly
- build: slim/average/muscular/stocky/petite
- height: short/average/tall (relative to others if shown)
- hair: length (short/medium/long), tone (light/dark/black/white), style (straight/wavy/spiky/tied)
- eyes: shape (round/narrow/sharp), size (large/medium/small)
- face: structure (round/angular/oval), notable features (sharp chin, high cheekbones, etc.)
- clothing: visible garments and style
- overall presence: dominant visual impression

Constraints:
- EXACTLY 72 tokens per character schema (critical for CLIP embedding)
- Describe ONLY visible physical attributes
- NO emotions, expressions, poses, or actions
- NO inferred or external information
- For grayscale manga: describe tones (light/dark) not colors
- If gender is ambiguous, state "ambiguous (appears male/female)"

Output format: One schema per line, no additional text.
